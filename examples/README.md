# Examples

## Shell

This is a basic snippet with shell command:

```sh
$ echo "Hello, runme!"
```

With `{name=hello}` you can annotate it and give it a nice name:

```sh { name=echo }
$ echo "Hello, runme!"
```

It can contain multiple lines too:

```sh
$ echo "1"
$ echo "2"
$ echo "3"
```

Also, the dollar sign is not needed:

```sh
echo "Hello, runme! Again!"
```

It works with `cd`, `pushd`, and similar because all lines are executed as a single script:

```sh
temp_dir=$(mktemp -d -t "runme-XXXXXXX")
pushd $temp_dir
echo "hi!" > hi.txt
pwd
cat hi.txt
popd
pwd
```

Sometimes, shell scripts fail:

```sh
echo ok
exit 1
```

### Piping

Try it with `echo "Hello" | runme run cat-stdin`:

```sh { name=cat-stdin interactive=false }
cat -
```

### Interactive Scripts

```sh { name=print-name }
echo -n "Enter your name: "
read name
echo "\nHi, $name!"
```

## JavaScript

It can also execute a snippet of JavaScript code:

```js { name=hello-js }
console.log("Hello World!");
```

## Go

It can also execute a snippet of Go code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Go, runme!")
}
```

## Unknown snippets

Snippets without provided type are ignored.

To still display unknown snippets, provide `--allow-unknown` to the `list` command.

```ini
[database]
username = admin
password = admin
```

## Categories

```sh { name=a category=a }
echo "Category A"
```

```sh { name=b category=a,b }
echo "Category A,B"
```

```sh { name=c category=a,b,c }
echo "Category A,B,C"
```
